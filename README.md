# Social Deep Link Redirecting

This project is a Linktree alternative that you can fork and update for your own use. This project can run on Github Pages allowing you to redirect to apps from within a separate app.

For example when using Instagram and you go into one of their browsers, the links on this page will take you out of that page and direct you to an app if it's installed.
